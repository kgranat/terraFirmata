#TerraFirmata<
This software is a basic datalogging system based around Arduino/Rapsberry Pi / Python.

We are using the pyfirmats library for the raspberry pi.

The firmware is a modifired version of the StandardFirmata libraries for Plant Chicago.

This version of the firmware allows for reading of a DHT Temperature and humidity sensor as well as output to an auilary LCD for data checking.
